**Project Name: BSQ - Finding the largest square in a map**

Description:
This project is a program written in C that reads a map from a file or generates a map based on given parameters, and finds the largest square that can be placed within the map, without overlapping any obstacles. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem efficiently, and outputs the solution on the standard output.

Features:

    Efficiently finds the largest square in a map
    Can read a map from a file or generate a map based on given parameters
    Handles error cases such as missing or invalid files

Usage:
To use the program, simply compile the code with the Makefile provided, and then run the resulting executable, providing the path to the map file as a command-line argument, or the board parameters if generating a board. For example:

make

./bsq map.txt

./bsq 10x10 "xxx...ooo"
